A sample app showing you how to control your applications without touching your
iOS device.

Uses OpenCV (build included) to run an optical flow analysis between frames,
which finds frame-to-frame feature correspondences. Consistent left-to-right or
right-to-left motion between consecutive frames causes a notification to fire.

TODO:
- expose key code as a gesture recognizer
- improve performance (currently good on iPad 2, not so hot on iPhone)
- improve recognition accuracy (objects entering / leaving the frame are a big
  problem)
- add 2-clause BSD license notice to files
